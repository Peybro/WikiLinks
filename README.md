# WikiLinks - A Firefox Addon
Adds an anchor link to every headline in Wikipedia.

## Example
If you're reading this on GitHub right now hover with your mouse over 'Example' and see the small icon left to it appear.

## Usage
At the time this is only usable via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`: `Load temporary Addon` and select index.js.

## Todo
* Remove the small white space between the headline and the icon
* Integrate JSX for better source code
* Deploy as a real Firefox Addon (right now it's just usable via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`)
* Develop for Chromium Brwosers, too
* Add support for ather Wikis, e.g. Fanpedia
