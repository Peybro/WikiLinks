# WikiLinks - A Firefox Addon
Adds an anchor link to every headline of a Wikipedia article for handy sharing.

## Example & Usage
If you're reading this on GitHub right now hover with your mouse over 'Example' and see the small icon left to it appear.
Clicking it will modify your current URL such that you can directly share the article you're refering to.

## Deploy Yourself
Goto <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox">about:debugging</a>, click on "Load temporary Addon" and select 'index.js'.
You can change the shown symbol by replacing the SVG in the source code. Just visit <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Icons</a> and choose one... Or just stick with the good old plain # .

## Todo
* [ðŸ•‘] Deploy as a real Firefox Addon (right now it's just usable via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`)
* [âœ…] ~~Replace EventListeners with CSS :hover for better performance~~
* [âœ…] ~~Remove the small white space between the headline and the icon~~
* [ðŸ’¨] ~~Integrate JSX for better source code~~
* [ðŸ”œ] Develop for Chromium Brwosers, too
* [ðŸ”œ] Add support for ather Wikis, e.g. Fanpedia

## A few more words
1. Big thank you to Bootstrap for their free icon set - looking at you, FontAwesome....
2. I hope Wikipedia will add this one day since it can be pretty handy from time to time. (Are they still woking on VUE.js implementation or is it done yet??)
3. I really don't know why I'm working so much on this little project which will probably hardly used by anyone. 
4. Actually I do know: I'm just procrastinating.... Have fun ;)
